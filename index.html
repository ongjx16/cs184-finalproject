      <h2 align="middle">Overview of Project</h2>
      <p>
        Being interested in physical simulation in computer graphics,
        particularly how video games simulate natural terrain, we decided to
        base our project around a common terrain type: grass. Through simulating
        how individual grass blades interact with each other in the presence of
        wind and external forces, we hope to gain a better appreciation for game
        development and the simulation of physics in computer graphics.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 align="middle">Summary of Accomplishments</h2>
      <h3>Implementation of Grass</h3>
      <p>
        We utilized 3 intersecting quads for the base unit of grass that we want
        to replicate and use for our infinite grass. Using an initial texture,
        we then propagated this image through GPU instancing to fill the terrain
        with grass. We generate and compute grass positions using a compute
        shader so that the grass positions are directly generated within the GPU
        buffer. The result is as per seen in Figure 1 and 2 below.
      </p>
      <h3>Addition of Noise</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we are able to generate grass on the screen, our next step is
        to make the grass look more natural. To do this, we want to add noise to
        the xyz-axis in order to make the appearance of grass more random and
        therefore, more natural. We achieve this using
        <code>Simplex.compute</code> which provides 2D/3D gradient noise
        functions. Through this, we are able to generate more realistic looking
        grass as seen in Figure 3 and 4.

      <h2 align="middle">Progress Relative to Plan</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with the work plan, we have managed to make significant
        progress in achieving 2 of our delivery goals thus far: to make the
        grass look natural and to make the grass look sufficiently populated.
      </p>

      <h2 align="middle">Updates to Work Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, we are working on the implementation of adding motions to
        physical stimuli like wind speeds and direction to create a more natural
        feel to the grass, as well as researching on optimal rendering methods
        to make our implementation as robust as possible. This is on schedule
        with the initial work plan proposed.
